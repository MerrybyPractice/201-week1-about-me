# 201-week1-about-me
My goal for this project was to let people guess things about me, using yes or no questions. I put in slightly different responses for yes/no vs 
y/n partially for humor, partially because at the time of writing the program I didn't know how to make it accept either answer and spit out the same answer in an elegant way. I added the third option for everything that isn't a yes/no answer to give myself more code to test, and provide something more entertaining if the user doesn't want to give a real answer.

Erik Enderleine provided help with placing the .toLowerCase() function, since I was having trouble with it. I would like to learn how to make it affect the variables globally, rather than having to repeat the function for each question.
